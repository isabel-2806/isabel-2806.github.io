        <p>LONDON—IF YOU TEND to believe what you hear, rather than what is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett">Syd Barrett</a> is either dead, behind bars, or a vegetable. He is in fact alive and as confusing as ever, in the town where he was born, Cambridge.</p>
        <p>In 1966–67, Barrett was playing lead guitar with Pink Floyd. He’d named the band and was writing most of their music, including the only two hit singles they ever had. His eerie electronic guitar style and gnome-like stage presence made him an authentic <a href="pages/Legacy.html">cult figure</a> for the nascent London underground, then just beginning to gather at the UFO club and the Roundhouse. The Floyd were a house band and the music went on into the wee hours.</p>
